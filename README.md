# What is Sauce?

Sauce is a Flutter Application that uses Image classification to identify the anime by uploading the image onto the app. It uses TensorFlow Lite to train models with 10 classes with close to a thousand images per class. We are continuously adding more classes to improve its accuracy and aim to be the number one open source Flutter Application with regards to anime.
